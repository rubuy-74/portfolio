# Overview

This project was started in 2018 as an app to help improve the daily lives of the students at FEUP. Nowadays, it supports the lives of around 5,000 students. 

# Technologies and Categories
+ Flutter

# What did I do?

When I joined the Informatics Club this was the first that I started to contribute and, during the first year didn't have a lot of contributions. But during my second year, I started to contribute more to the app and I'm very thankful for that.

# What have I learned?

During my years in projects, I learned a lot about Flutter and Mobile Development.

# Would I do something different?

I would spend more time contributing to the project, as I believe it would make me even more comfortable with mobile development and overall programming.
