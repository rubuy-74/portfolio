# What did I do?

Contributing to this project was a challenge for me, since I have never even touched on anything like it, so first I had to learn how it worked and a little about the technologies on it. For that, I started with the Kubernetes Bootcamp on their website, some Docker tutorials and a lot of documentation from the Ansible team.

Even after all of that, my contributions were somewhat sub-optimal and I wish to have more contributions (which I plan to do this next academic year). My real contributions were setting up a DHCP server and fixing an issue with a failsafe protocol.

# What have I learned?

Even if my contributions were not really significant, I feel like I've learned tons about DevOps, Github Actions and everything related to infrastructure and how all of that works.

For that, I give my sincere thank you to [Luis Duarte](https://github.com/LuisDuarte1/) and [Jos√© Costa](https://github.com/Sirze01), which were the minds behind the whole project and the people who fueled even more my passion for working in something great.

# Would I do something different?

I would probably give more of my time to contribute and be more involved in this project.
