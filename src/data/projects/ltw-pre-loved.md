# Overview

This project was developed during the "Web Technologies Laboratory Course" course, where our task was to build a OLX clone using only pure PHP, HMTL, CSS and Javascript.

This project was tougher than I imagined, tailwind and frameworks like React or Laravel really make things a LOT easier.

# What did I do?

During this project I contribute to a little bit of everything but I was mostly involved in the profile page and the admin dashboard (similarly on the everyday.dev website). I've worked with the Graph.js library to show analytics in a more intuitive and simple way.

For the backend, me and another team member developed the database schema and implemented it which took some time, but helped us learn a lot about how they work and what some of its specifities.

# What have I learned?

This was the project that actually teached me how to web development work and how to work with it. I would recommend anyone that really wants to understand how to develop in the web, for either frontend or backend, work on a project (even if small) in the native technologies. It's hard but it is worth it.

# Would I do something different?

I would probably give more of my time to create a small Javascript framework to facilitate the development of some of the components, as I saw done in some projects from previous years.
