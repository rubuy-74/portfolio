# What did I do?

Since I started to contribute to this project, most of my work was finishing and closing open PRs on the repository. The website's backend is already very robust, which gave me the opportunity to experience a well rounded Spring Boot project, with a proper documentation and proper testing.

On the frontend, I was responsible for one of the pages and helped people that are working in the team.

# What have I learned?

This project has introduced me to Spring Boot and showed me how a robust and clean project looks like. The people before me did a great job and I personally appreciate to be working in this project.

# Would I do something differently?

As I'm currently contributing to this project, I can't really talk about what I would do differently but I plan to keep contributing.
