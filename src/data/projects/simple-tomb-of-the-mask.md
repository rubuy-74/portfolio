# Overview

This project was developed during the "Tests and Development Laboratory" course where the task was to develop a game using the Lanterna framework in Java. This framework is mostly focused on graphics.

Aside from the development of the game, we had to learn and implement design patterns (at least 7 to have a good grade) and have tests for all of the functionalities of the game.

# What did I do?

In this project we used a font to display the different entities and I was the one responsible for creating that font and most of the tests. Aside from this, at the end we had to refactor most of the code to adapt a larger number of design patterns and I had a big role in that process.

# What have I learned?

I learned how to create tests and how the tests apply to different aspects of an application and I wished to use that knowledge in more projects in University, but with a tight schedule for the projects, this was not really possible.

This project had an important role of teaching me design patterns and how they work. At a first glance, design patterns seem kind of useless or just unnecessary junk, but after the end of that project I realized its importance and how it can improve organization within a project.

# Would I do something different?

I would probably work more on the development of the game itself. For this course I shifted all my focus on creating tests and ensuring that we had good tests that really tested the features of the game and its logic.

For that I am proud of the work we did, but I feel like it could help me to be more experienced in Java at the time (that changed in the future, as I got to experience more of Java and fell in love with the language).
